# TheMonetaryMavericks

This github page is used for a UVA course. It involves a code for a model that simulates the housing market and looks at the results of the average house prices. Further it checks what the impact is of interest rates on it.

The file Simulation model.ipynb is the working model that simulates the housing market that is validated and well. The file Attempt to model bidding (no final model).ipynb was an attempt on another more complicated variant of the model.
This model is however not validated, so it's not used as eventual model. The csv files are necessary for running the models, because the data in it is used in the models.
The files are simply notebook files. So if the used libraries (numpy, panda, matplotlib, mesa, seaborn and random) are installed, it can be runned like a jupyter notebook.
